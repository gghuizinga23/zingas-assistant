# Setting up Val on her cloud computer

One part at a time. Gerrit says "done" after each; I do the rest.

| # | Part | Who | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ✅ | Install Orgo's small helper tool on this laptop and sign in to Orgo in the browser. Lets me copy Val's files to her computer without uploading them anywhere else | Gerrit signs in, I install | 3 min |
| 2 ✅ | Copy Val's rules, personality and skills onto her computer (backing up what's there first) | Me | 5 min |
| 3 ✅ | Sign Val in to Nous Portal (her brain): open a link, enter a code | Gerrit | 3 min |
| 4 ✅ | Connect Val's Telegram chat | Gerrit | 5 min |
| 5 | Two read-only 1Password "service accounts", one per vault; paste each into Val's computer, never into chat | Gerrit | 10 min |
| 6 | Turn on the healthchecks.io check-ins | Me, with Gerrit's link | 3 min |
| 7 | Test: close the laptop and text Val | Gerrit | 2 min |

**Done 2026-10-21:** Orgo helper installed in ~/.orgo-cli (signed in as gghuizinga23@gmail.com).
Val's files merged into the Orgo Hermes template with `files/install-on-orgo.py` (it keeps the template's
own config and adds ours on top). The old settings are backed up on Val's computer in
/root/.hermes/backups/pre-zingas-20261021-132025. Telegram was already connected by Orgo at launch.
Nous Portal signed in (gerrithuizinga@zingashome.com). Val's brain now runs through Nous, same model as
before (Claude Sonnet 5.5, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5`), instead of Orgo's built-in AI credits.
The settings before this switch are in /root/.hermes/backups/config.before-nous.yaml. Test reply: "ok".
Telegram: Gerrit connected the bot chat on Orgo's site and sees it on the iPhone. Only 1 person is
allowed to talk to Val (home chat 8703312605). The laptop-off test (part 7) is the first real message.

**Later (not today):** connect Gmail and Calendar through mail-bridge; the
approvals chat and customer texting once Quo is approved; Plaud once it arrives.

**Rules that hold the whole way:**
- Nothing goes to GitHub or anywhere else; files go straight from this laptop to Val's computer.
- No passwords or keys in chat.
- Val can't send email or text customers yet.
